Update the screen section in html

Update the screen section to see both the last button pressed but also
the previous content. When pressing an opBtn a second time compute the
result and then make that result the firstNum. 

Need to figure out why operate isn't working properly.
When pressing a second operator the result is undefined,
when pressing the equal button it doesn't do anything.
